# SpecKit Constitution

## Core Principles

### Code Quality
- **Maintainability**: Code must be clear, well-documented, and follow established conventions
- **Consistency**: All code follows standardized formatting, naming conventions, and architectural patterns
- **Testability**: Code is structured to be easily testable with minimal external dependencies
- **No Technical Debt**: Each commit reduces or maintains current debt levels; no intentional shortcuts
- **Standards Compliance**: Adherence to language-specific best practices and style guides

### Testing Standards
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Minimum 80% code coverage for critical paths
- **Test Types**: Unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests for all features
- **Automated Validation**: All tests must run automatically in CI/CD pipeline
- **Test Maintenance**: Tests are treated as first-class code and maintained alongside implementation
- **Performance Testing**: Load and stress tests validate system behavior under expected conditions

### User Experience Consistency
- **Unified Design System**: All user-facing elements follow documented design patterns and component library
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance as minimum standard across all interfaces
- **Responsive Design**: Consistent experience across all device sizes and breakpoints
- **Clear Communication**: Error messages, status indicators, and feedback are contextual and actionable
- **Intuitive Navigation**: User flows are predictable and minimize cognitive load

### Performance Requirements
- **Load Time Targets**: Initial page load under 3 seconds on standard connections
- **Interactive Performance**: First Contentful Paint (FCP) under 1.8 seconds
- **Runtime Performance**: No tasks blocking user input for longer than 100ms
- **Resource Optimization**: Minimize bundle sizes, optimize images, lazy-load non-critical content
- **Monitoring**: Continuous performance metrics tracked and reviewed during development
